# ⚫⚪ Revello

Revello is a Rust-based project for exploring and experimenting with an
**Othello (Reversi) bot**.

## ⚙️ How it works

At its core, the bot combines an efficient **bitboard-based move
generator** with a **search algorithm**.
The search engine includes several techniques:

-   **Alpha-Beta Pruning** -- reduces the number of positions evaluated
    by pruning irrelevant branches.
-   **Transposition Tables** -- caches previously evaluated positions to
    avoid redundant work.
-   **Iterative Deepening** -- gradually deepens the search, allowing
    early cutoffs and better move ordering.
-   **Move Ordering** -- prioritizes promising moves based on results
    from earlier searches.

## 🚀 Running the program

You can run the program in different modes using Cargo:

``` bash
# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 vs 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Play human vs human
cargo run -- play human-vs-human

# Play human vs AI
# 🤖 vs 🧑 Play human vs AI
cargo run -- play human-vs-ai

# Play AI vs AI
# 🤖 vs 🤖 Play AI vs AI
cargo run -- play ai-vs-ai
```

## 🛠️ Implementation details
